## Project Description

This is a project that I have wanted to create for a while. Version 1 includes a remodeled version of a childhood favorite game called "Bop It" built entirely in react. Version 2 adds a journal feature with user authorization using react for the front-end and Django/Python for the back-end database. This feature will provide full CRUD operations for journal entries. Version 3 adds the final feature; a music player.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The mvp functionality will include basic character search abilities using character name and the ability to save specific characters to a list of favorites.

#### MVP 
- Construct app components
- Construct routes
- Construct "Bop-it" components
- Construct "Bop-it" functionality 
- Add animations
- Add component styling
- Add sound clips
#### PostMVP 
- Construct Journal component
- Create full CRUD capabilities for journal
- User auth for journal
- Style journal component
- Construct music component
- Style music component

##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the title | 
| Nav | This will render the nav | 
| Episode | This will render the episode name and number |
| Favorites | This will render a list of favorite characters |
| CharacterInfo | This will render the information about the characters searched |
| Location | This will render the locations |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Create components | H | 8hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Game functionality | H | 12hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Routing | H | 2hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Links | H | 2hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Styling | H | 16hrs| TBD | TBD |
| CRUD | H | 12hrs| TBD | TBD |
| User auth | H | 10hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Music player | H | 24hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Total | H | 86hrs| TBD | TBD |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.
